# Client-Side Marathon Project
Every business owner must every year file a document declaring all equipment, furniture. The form
requires a brief description for some item (or group of items) along with the data purchased and cost.
When an item is no longer in use, it must be declared as “deleted” from use. When items are purchased
in the last year, they are listed as “additions”.

## Getting Started

Your task is to produce a website that after entry for one year allows a business owner to reuse the data
in the next year (and subsequent years). The site in real life would print the form; however, that is
beyond the scope of this project.
Also, a real project would store the data in a small server-side database; however, we will simply store
the data in localStorage. (You will learn about that later in the semester.)
We are not graphic designers; however, you should produce a site that is “clean”, readable,
understandable, and usable for an average business owner or clerical person.
